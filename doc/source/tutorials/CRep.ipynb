    "# Tutorial: A Beginner's Guide to Probabilistic Generative Models and the CRep Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial on using the _Probabilistic Generative Models for Network Analysis_ (`pgm`) package. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of running the `CRep` algorithm on a sample dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CRep` algorithm (which name comes from a mix of \"Community and Reciprocity\") is a probabilistic generative model used for network analysis. It is designed to detect communities within a network and quantify the level of reciprocity. Reciprocity, in this context, refers to the tendency of node pairs to form mutual connections."

    "## Package Structure\n",
    "Before delving into the usage of the _CRep_ algorithm, let's explore the structure of the `pgm` package, which is organized into four main modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input\n",
    "The `input` module handles data input for subsequent use by the algorithms in the `model` module. It comprises the following submodules:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `loader`: Functions to load data from input files.  \n",
    "- `preprocessing`: Functions for data preprocessing, such as converting NetworkX graphs to sparse adjacency matrices.  \n",
    "- `tools`: Utility functions for working with matrices, tensors, and sparsity.  \n",
    "- `stats`: Functions for computing statistics on the data.  \n",
    "- `generate_networks`: Functions for generating synthetic networks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases where users have their own data, they typically use only the `loader` and `preprocessing` modules. The other modules serve as internal components supporting these primary functionalities. The `generate_networks` module is utilized when no data is available, and the user wants to generate synthetic networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model\n",
    "The `model` module encompasses the implementation of various algorithms, including the following submodules:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `CRep`: Implementation of the `CRep` algorithm.  \n",
    "- `JointCRep`: Implementation of the `JointCRep` algorithm. \n",
    "- `cv_CRep`: Cross-validation for the CRep algorithm.\n",
    "- `cv`: Implementation of the general cross-validation algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Output\n",
    "The `output` module contains functions responsible for handling the outputs of the models. It consists of the following submodules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `evaluate`: Essential functions for model assessment, such as AUC for link prediction, conditional and marginal expectations, and the pseudo log-likelihood of the data.\n",
    "- `plot`: Functions for visualizing the results and performance metrics of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data\n",
    "The `data` module contains the data files used by the package. It consists of the following submodules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `input`: Input data files.\n",
    "- `model`: Configuration files for the models."

    "## Configuration\n",
    "Let's start by configuring the algorithm and the parameters needed. The pipeline works based on two types of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical Parameters:** these are operational parameters that control the execution of the algorithm. They are not directly related to the model's theoretical framework but are crucial for its practical implementation. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convergence tolerance:** This is a threshold used to determine when the algorithm has converged, i.e., when the changes in the model's parameters between iterations are small enough to consider the model as having reached its final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum number of iterations:** This is the maximum number of times the algorithm will update the model's parameters. If the model hasn't converged by this point, the algorithm will stop anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of realizations:** In the context of the `CRep` algorithm, this refers to the number of times the entire process (initialization and iterative updates) is repeated. This is done to account for the randomness in the initialization step and to ensure a more robust final model. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are set by default in the model's class definition, but they can be changed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model parameters:**  These are parameters that are part of the model's theoretical framework. They have a direct impact on the model's behavior and the results it produces. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of communities (K)**: This is a fundamental parameter of the `CRep` algorithm. It determines the number of communities the algorithm will try to find in the network. Each node in the network will be assigned to one of these communities, at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reciprocity coefficient (eta)**: This is another fundamental parameter of the `CRep` algorithm. It quantifies the level of reciprocity in the network, i.e., the tendency of node pairs to form mutual connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are set by the user in the configuration file corresponding to the used model. In the case of the `CRep` algorithm, this file is `setting_CRep.yaml`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the data is not a parameter, but an input to the algorithm, hence, it is not included in the default configuration of the class nor in the configuration file. This will be shown later in the tutorial."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on using the Probabilistic Generative Models for Network Analysis (`pgm`) package, specifically focusing on the `CRep` algorithm. The `CRep` algorithm is a probabilistic generative model used for network analysis, designed to detect communities within a network and quantify the level of reciprocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial begins by explaining the structure of the `pgm` package, which is organized into four main modules: `input`, `model`, `output`, and `data`. Each module has its own submodules and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial then proceeds to demonstrate how to configure the `CRep` algorithm using a YAML configuration file. It shows how to load the configuration file, modify the output folder path, and save the updated configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the tutorial guides the user on how to import data using the `pgm` package. It demonstrates how to load data from an input file and print basic statistics of the loaded data. It also shows how to visualize the adjacency matrix of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial then explains how to run the `CRep` model. It demonstrates how to create an instance of the `CRep` class and run the model using the `fit` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the tutorial shows how to analyze the results produced by the model. It explains how to load the results from a file, unpack the latent variables, and calculate the hard membership for the in-coming case. It concludes by referring the user to a publication for more details about the meaning of the latent variables.\n",
